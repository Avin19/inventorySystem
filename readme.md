# Problem statement :
## Create an inventory system.
### Features:
1. Store items in the inventory. The item’s model/prefab and maximum capacity
that this item should be allowed in inventory must stored in a configuration
file.
2. Get the item from the inventory whenever required in the scene using any
button click. Eg. using the “space” button. The object should spawn in the
scene.
3. Create a small UI to show the item name and amount in the inventory. It
should update whenever an item changes.
